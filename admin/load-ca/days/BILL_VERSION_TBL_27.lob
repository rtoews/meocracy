However, some developments need significant renovation, beyond that which can be covered by existing project reserves, or are running
		  at a deficit that is not sustainable on a long-term basis. As developments age, more and more are likely to fall into this category.</p><p>(c)<span class="EnSpace"/>There are decreasing sources of public funding available to cover needed renovations, and to eliminate operating deficits. For at least the next few years, private debt and equity generated through the sale of low-income housing tax credits will likely be the main source of capital for this purpose.</p><p>(d)<span class="EnSpace"/>Accessing private debt and tax credit equity sometimes requires restructuring the regulatory restrictions applicable to a development, including increasing rents. Recognizing this, the Legislature previously enacted legislation, Senate Bill 707 in 2007, authorizing the restructuring of regulatory restrictions for some of the oldest developments. This legislation applied only to selected department programs that were active in the 1980s.</p><p>(e)<span class="EnSpace"/>Renovation needs have come to light in a number of projects financed under another set of department programs, dating from the early to mid 1990s. To address these needs, authority is needed for a similar restructuring of regulatory restrictions for these projects.</p><p>(f)<span class="EnSpace"/>It is the intent of the Legislature that the regulatory restructurings needed to facilitate renovations and eliminate operating deficits minimize the impact on existing tenants, particularly those with the lowest incomes, and preserve as much affordability as possible.</p><p>(g)<span class="EnSpace"/>Rather than have multiple different restructuring programs, it is more efficient to have one program, applicable to all of the department’s older programs, with variations only where essential to address unique situations associated with the existing historical
		  programs.</p></caml:Content></caml:BillSection><caml:BillSection id="id_ECCE360C-9A7F-45A8-BD17-7189B5DB53BD"><caml:Num>SEC. 2.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_REPEALED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:HSC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'DIVISION'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'31.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'PART'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'3.2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'50515.2.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 50515.2 of the <caml:DocName>Health and Safety Code</caml:DocName> is repealed.</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><?xm-deletion_mark data="&lt;caml:LawSection id=&quot;id_BE3CC50F-7A8A-4539-A9BE-0C9D6E117670&quot;>&lt;caml:Num>50515.2.&lt;/caml:Num>&lt;caml:LawSectionVersion id=&quot;id_DAEEC4A9-0EC4-4178-9045-59A5E13ACBC2&quot;>&lt;caml:Content>&lt;xhtml:p>(a)&lt;xhtml:span class=&quot;EnSpace&quot;/>Notwithstanding any other law, the department may extend the term of an existing multifamily housing loan made by the department under the original Rental Housing Construction Program established by Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 50735); the Special User Housing Rehabilitation Program established by Section 50670; or the Deferred Payment Rehabilitation Loan Program established by Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section 50660) upon the request of any borrower subject to the following conditions:&lt;/xhtml:p>&lt;xhtml:p>(1)&lt;xhtml:span class=&quot;EnSpace&quot;/>The borrower shall provide to the department a complete report showing all existing tenants, their incomes, as reported in the most recent annual income certification, and the rents currently charged to each tenant.&lt;/xhtml:p>&lt;xhtml:p>(2)&lt;xhtml:span class=&quot;EnSpace&quot;/>The borrower shall agree to an extension of the term of the loan by an additional 55 years from the date of departmental approval.

All future payments of principal and interest may be deferred except for a percentage of interest equal to the percentage charged in the Multifamily Housing

If a rent increase authorized under this section would exceed a 10 percent increase in payment for a lower income tenant, the project owner shall phase in the increase so that it does not exceed 10 percent per year. After the initial operating year after the extension authorized under this section, the rents for all regulated units that are subject to the new agreement may be adjusted in the percentage calculated pursuant to the Multifamily Housing Program criteria, plus the amount necessary to bring an individual tenant up to the 30-percent-of-income standard, provided that the total annual increase does not exceed 10 percent.
