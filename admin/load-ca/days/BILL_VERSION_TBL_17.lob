For purposes of this limitation, “full cash value” is defined as the assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. Existing property tax law specifies those circumstances in which the transfer of ownership interests results in a change in ownership of the real property, and provides that certain transfers do not result in a change of ownership.</p><p>This bill would provide that a transfer of a cotenancy interest, as defined, in real property from one cotenant to the other that takes effect upon the death of the transferor cotenant and that occurs on or after January 1, 2013, does not constitute a change of ownership, as
		provided. This bill would require the transferor cotenant to sign an affidavit, as specified, under penalty of perjury.</p><p>By imposing new duties upon local tax officials with respect to changes in ownership of real property, and by requiring the transferor cotenant to sign an affidavit under penalty of perjury which would expand the scope of the existing crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p><p>The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p><p>This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p><p>With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the
		Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.</p><p>Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires the Legislature to reimburse local agencies annually for certain property tax revenues lost as a result of any exemption or classification of property for purposes of ad valorem property taxation.</p><p>This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2229 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse local agencies for property tax revenues lost by them pursuant to the bill.</p><p>This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>YES</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>YES</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>YES</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_D50D5174-75CB-44C6-8273-C48A0D79F08A"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_ADDED" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:RTC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2F%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'62.3.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION" xlink:type="locator">Section 62.3 is added to the <caml:DocName>Revenue and Taxation Code</caml:DocName>, to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_3D9D48B9-0D82-4CC0-B6C3-835C2D249DF3"><caml:Num>62.3.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_02AD5E14-3615-476B-AD75-A9D2DBB52CE7"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, a change in ownership shall not include a transfer of a cotenancy interest in real property from one cotenant to the other that takes effect upon the death of the transferor cotenant if all of the following conditions apply:</p><p>(1)<span class="EnSpace"/>The transfer is solely by and between either of the following:</p><p>(A)<span class="EnSpace"/>Two joint tenants who together own 100 percent of the real property in joint tenancy.</p><p>(B)<span class="EnSpace"/>Two individuals who together own 100 percent of the real property as tenants in common.</p><p>(2)<span class="EnSpace"/>As a result of the death of
