Existing law prescribes specified licensing fees, and requires that the fees be adjusted annually, as directed by the Legislature in the annual Budget Act, by an amount not to exceed the California Consumer Price Index, as specified. Existing law requires that these fees be deposited in the Nursing Home Administrator’s State License Examining Fund, a continuously appropriated fund.</p><p>This bill would instead require that these fees be deposited into a continuously appropriated account, which would be established as the Nursing Home Administrator Licensing Account in the State Department of Public Health Licensing and Certification Program Fund. This bill would authorize the department to adjust these fees, and would remove the adjustment limitation relating to the California
		Consumer Price Index. Because the bill would authorize an increase in the amount of fees deposited into a continuously appropriated account, the bill would make an appropriation. </p><p>This bill would require the department, by January 15 of each year, to prepare certain reports relating to nursing home administrator fees, fee adjustments, and nursing home administration generally. The bill would require the department to submit these reports to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature and to post these reports on its Internet Web site.</p><p>The bill also would make a technical, conforming change relating to the Nursing Home Administrator’s State License Examining Fund.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>YES</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>NO</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_F2673FAE-6426-49BA-A74D-7ED8CD061A8A"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_AMENDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:HSC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'DIVISION'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'ARTICLE'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'1266.9.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 1266.9 of the <caml:DocName>Health and Safety Code</caml:DocName> is amended to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_8948EA7F-2E38-4EEA-8F05-129EBFB358C7"><caml:Num>1266.9.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_57E7615B-79EA-4480-BDB2-115DE07488E6"><caml:Content><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(a)<?xm-insertion_mark_end?><?xm-insertion_mark_start?><span class="EnSpace"/><?xm-insertion_mark_end?>There is hereby created in the State Treasury the State Department of Public Health Licensing and Certification Program Fund.
