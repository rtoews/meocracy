Existing law also requires every motor carrier of property to comply with specified safety, permit, and liability insurance regulations and to pay the fees required by these provisions.</p><p>Existing law prohibits a broker of construction trucking services, as defined, from furnishing construction transportation services to a construction project unless it has secured a surety bond of not less than $15,000 executed by an admitted surety insurer.</p><p>This bill would require a broker of construction trucking services to provide a copy of the surety bond when requested by a person who is reasonably likely to contract with the
		broker for construction transportation services and to annually provide a copy of the surety bond to a 3rd-party nonprofit organization that is related to the industry and regularly maintains a published database of bonded brokers or to post a current copy of the surety bond on the broker’s Internet Web site.</p><p>The bill would prohibit a person from hiring, or otherwise engaging the services of, a broker of construction trucking services unless the person obtains a copy of the broker’s surety bond before services commence and would require a person who hires or otherwise engages the services of a broker of construction trucking services to maintain a copy of the bond for the duration of the contract or period of service plus one year.</p><p>The bill also would prohibit a broker of construction trucking services from hiring or otherwise engaging the services of, a motor carrier of property to furnish construction transportation
