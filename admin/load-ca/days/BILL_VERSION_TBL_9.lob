Existing law requires that the registration include the person’s address, fingerprints, current photograph, and license plate number. Existing law requires the registrant to update his or her registration annually, upon moving, or upon changing his or her name. Under existing law, failure to register is a crime. Existing law, as amended by Proposition 83 of the November 7, 2006, statewide general election, prohibits any person who is required to register pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act from residing within 2,000 feet of any public or private school, or park where children regularly gather.</p><p>This bill would make it a misdemeanor for any person convicted of a crime committed against a minor under the age of 14 who, because of that conviction, is required to
		register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act to be outside his or her domicile without a state-issued identification card, as defined.</p><p>The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p><p>This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>YES</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_387BA8E8-7A6B-4406-AB2E-2A6DA16CE97C"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_ADDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:PEN:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2F%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'290.035'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 290.035 is added to the <caml:DocName>Penal Code</caml:DocName>, to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_4A6C34DD-36FC-4E55-B70E-4C0177E45E11"><caml:Num>290.035.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_23333F64-C96D-4FA5-8690-11477AC9F62C"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>Any person convicted of a crime committed against a minor under the age of 14 who, because of that conviction, is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the Sex Offender Registration Act shall carry a state-issued identification card at all times when he or she is outside of his or her domicile.
