Existing law designates the contents of a continuing care contract, including the conditions under which a resident of a continuing care retirement community may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred from his or her designated living unit.</p><p>Under existing law, an entity that issues, delivers, or publishes, or as manager or officer or in any other administrative capacity, assists in the issuance, delivery, or publication of any printed matter, oral representation, or advertising material that does not comply with the requirements of the law relating to continuing care contracts is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p><p>Under existing law, the department licenses and regulates residential care facilities for the elderly, as defined.</p><p>This bill would exempt a care at-home program, as defined, from the licensing provisions applicable to residential care facilities for the elderly, if certain conditions are met. The bill would define a continuing care at-home program as a care at-home program operated by a continuing care provider that meets prescribed requirements provided for in the bill. The bill would increase from $7,500 to $10,000 the maximum entrance fee for certain residence agreements that is exempt from continuing care contract provisions, and would require adjustments for cost-of-living increases every 4 years.</p><p>By revising the provisions relating to continuing care providers, this bill would change the definition of an existing crime, thus imposing a state‑mandated local program.</p><p>The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p><p>This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>YES</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_68BC5251-3E1B-43FB-A50E-B9C8A6362ECC"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_AMENDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:HSC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'DIVISION'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'3.2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'ARTICLE'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'1569.145.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 1569.145 of the <caml:DocName>Health and Safety Code</caml:DocName> is amended to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_26C98323-3B11-4543-AC8B-5161C2A9C93A"><caml:Num>1569.145.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_C7EFD18A-0C2F-4B5C-8D26-4BDDE1EC3B3F"><caml:Content><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/><?xm-insertion_mark_end?>This chapter shall not apply to any of the following:</p><?xm-deletion_mark data="&lt;xhtml:p>(a)&lt;/xhtml:p>"?><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(1)<?xm-insertion_mark_end?><span class="EnSpace"/>A health facility, as defined by Section 1250.</p><?xm-deletion_mark data="&lt;xhtml:p>(b)&lt;/xhtml:p>"?><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(2)<?xm-insertion_mark_end?><span class="EnSpace"/>A clinic, as defined by Section 1200.</p><?xm-deletion_mark data="&lt;xhtml:p>(c)&lt;/xhtml:p>"?><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(3)<?xm-insertion_mark_end?><span class="EnSpace"/>A facility conducted by and for the adherents of a well-recognized church or religious denomination for the purpose of providing facilities for the care or treatment of the sick who depend upon prayer or spiritual means for healing in the practice of the religion of that church or denomination.</p><?xm-deletion_mark data="&lt;xhtml:p>(d)&lt;/xhtml:p>"?><p><?xm-insertion_mark_start?>(4)<?xm-insertion_mark_end?><span class="EnSpace"/>A house, institution, hotel, congregate housing project for the elderly, or other similar place that is limited to providing one or more of the following: housing, meals, transportation, housekeeping, or recreational and social activities; or that have residents independently accessing supportive services, provided, however, that no resident thereof requires an element of care and supervision or protective supervision as determined by the director.
