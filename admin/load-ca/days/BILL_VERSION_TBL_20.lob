The bill would authorize the commission to limit this reporting requirement to those particular types of claims that the commission determines are likely to involve claims or allegations that could jeopardize the lives or health of Californians. The bill would require the commission to
		develop and adopt the report form to be used by a public utility to comply with this reporting requirement. The bill would require specified civil penalties to be imposed for a violation of these requirements.</p><p>Under existing law, a violation of any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.</p><p>Because a violation of these requirements of the commission would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p><p> The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
