The juvenile court must adjudicate a petition to declare a detained minor a ward of the court within 15 days after the petition is filed. Existing law, contained in 2 initiative statutes, commonly known as the Three Strikes law, requires increased penalties for certain recidivist offenders in addition to any other enhancement or penalty provisions that may apply. Existing law requires that if a defendant has 2 or more prior violent or serious felony convictions, the term for the current felony conviction shall be an indeterminate term of imprisonment in the state prison for life with a minimum term to be served, as specified. Under certain circumstances, a juvenile adjudication constitutes a violent or serious felony conviction under those provisions.</p><p>This bill would
		provide that a youth who is 16 years of age or older at the time of the commission of an offense that could be used as a future felony conviction under the Three Strikes law is entitled to a jury trial in the juvenile court. Under this bill, the jury trial would proceed in the same manner as a jury trial in criminal court. This bill would provide that the right to a jury trial does not affect the right of a detained minor to adjudication of the petition to declare him or her a ward of the court within 15 days of the filing of the petition. This bill would also make conforming changes.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>NO</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_E440A3F4-EEBF-4F87-83E5-3CD84D21F91B"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_ADDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:WIC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2F%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'679.5'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 679.5 is added to the <caml:DocName>Welfare and Institutions Code</caml:DocName>, to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_B7BDC04A-D8C1-48EC-845E-1931640717A7"><caml:Num>679.5.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_C32BF964-D033-4106-9FB7-D820D2A159F2"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>A youth who is 16 years of age or older at the time of the commission of an offense, which, upon admission or adjudication, could be used as a future felony conviction under paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 667 of the Penal Code or under paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of Section 1170.12 of the Penal Code, shall be entitled to a jury trial.</p><p>(b)<span class="EnSpace"/>A jury trial under this section shall proceed as provided in Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 1041) and Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 1046) of Title 6 of, and Title 7 (commencing with Section 1065) of, Part 2 of the Penal Code.</p><p>(c)<span class="EnSpace"/>This section does not affect the right of a detained youth under Section 657 to a trial
