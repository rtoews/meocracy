Existing law requires agencies receiving reports from mandated reporters to forward a report to the Department of Justice in writing of every case it investigates of known or suspected child abuse or severe neglect that is determined to be substantiated. Existing law requires an agency receiving reports from mandated reporters to notify, in writing, the known or suspected child abuser that he or she has been reported to the Child Abuse Central Index
		(CACI) whenever that agency forwards a report in writing to the Department of Justice.</p><p>This bill would, if the known or suspected child abuser is a minor, require the agency to additionally notify the minor’s current caregiver, the minor’s parent or parents or legal guardian, as applicable, the minor’s attorney, if any, and the minor’s guardian ad litem, if any. Because this bill would require a local agency to provide additional notification, it would impose a state-mandated local program.</p><p>(2)<span class="EnSpace"/>Existing law requires the removal of the listing of any person in the CACI who has reached 100 years of age.</p><p>This bill would additionally require the removal of any person listed in the CACI as of January 1, 2013, who was listed prior to reaching 18 years of age if the person is listed only once in the CACI with no subsequent listings. The bill would require the removal
		of any person listed in the CACI who was listed prior to reaching 18 years of age if the incident or incidents resulting in the listing or listings did not result in the person being adjudicated a ward of the court or in a criminal conviction.</p><p>(3)<span class="EnSpace"/>Existing law requires the Department of Justice to act as a repository of reports of suspected child abuse and severe neglect to be maintained in the CACI. Existing law requires that only information from reports that are reported as substantiated shall be filed, and requires all other determinations to be removed from the central list.</p><p>This bill would require the information in the report to be deleted if a suspected child abuser was a minor at the time the report was filed, provided that no subsequent report concerning the same suspected child abuser has been received prior to the suspected child abuser reaching 18 years of age.</p><p>(4)<span class="EnSpace"/>The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p><p>This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>YES</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_2F21DCA6-2CD6-4F1C-9D5E-64BE52AA033D"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_AMENDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:PEN:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'PART'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'4.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'TITLE'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'1.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'ARTICLE'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.5.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'11169.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 11169 of the <caml:DocName>Penal Code</caml:DocName> is amended to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_AB9EC407-1C58-4878-9174-3298AE75596C"><caml:Num>11169.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_9EC04C0A-840B-4D59-9C15-5EAF811416B3"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>An agency specified in Section 11165.9 shall forward to the Department of Justice a report in writing of every case it investigates of known or suspected child abuse or severe neglect that is determined to be substantiated, other than cases coming within subdivision (b) of Section 11165.2.
