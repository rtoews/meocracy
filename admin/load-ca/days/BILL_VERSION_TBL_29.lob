Existing law requires by October 1, 2010, that the State Board of Education, taking into consideration specified findings and recommendations, adopt regulations for alternative means by which eligible pupils with disabilities, as defined, may demonstrate that they have achieved the same level of academic achievement in the content standards required for passage of the high school exit examination.</p><p>Existing law defines an eligible pupil with a disability as a pupil who has, among other things, an anticipated graduation date and is scheduled to receive a high school diploma on or after January 1, 2011, and the school district or state special school certifies that the pupil has satisfied or will satisfy all other state
		and local requirements for the receipt of a high school diploma on or after January 1, 2011. Existing law authorizes an eligible pupil with a disability, commencing January 1, 2011, to participate in the alternative means of demonstrating the level of academic achievement in the content standards required for passage of the high school exit examination in the manner prescribed by the regulations adopted by the state board.</p><p>This bill would instead define an eligible pupil with a disability as a pupil who has, among other things, an anticipated graduation date and is scheduled to receive a high school diploma on or after July 1, 2015, and the school district or state special school certifies that the pupil has satisfied or will satisfy all other state and local requirements for the receipt of a high school diploma on or after July 1, 2015. The bill would instead authorize an eligible pupil with a disability, commencing July 1, 2015, to participate in the alternative
		means of demonstrating the level of academic achievement in the content standards required for passage of the high school exit examination in the manner prescribed by the regulations adopted by the state board. The bill would also make conforming and technical, nonsubstantive changes.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>NO</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_F476219F-B261-4488-8500-9777E790B91C"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_AMENDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:EDC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'TITLE'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'2.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'DIVISION'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'4.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'PART'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'33.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'9.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'60852.1.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 60852.1 of the <caml:DocName>Education Code</caml:DocName> is amended to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_A014EE6B-9574-4023-840E-327050804131"><caml:Num>60852.1.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_3DCBC954-A706-4125-BA74-5AA158BC3E30"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>The Superintendent shall recommend, and the state board shall select, members of a panel that will convene to make recommendations regarding alternative means for eligible pupils with disabilities to demonstrate that they have achieved the same level of academic achievement in the content standards in English language arts or mathematics, or both, required for passage of the high school exit examination.</p><p>(1)<span class="EnSpace"/>The panel shall be composed of educators and other individuals who have experience with the population of pupils with disabilities eligible for alternative means of demonstrating academic achievement, as defined in Section 60852.2, and educators and other individuals who have expertise with multiple forms of
