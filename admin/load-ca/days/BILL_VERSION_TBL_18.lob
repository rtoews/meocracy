The funds in the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financing Account are available for expenditure by the board, upon appropriation by the Legislature, with regard to a specified grant and loan program. Under the existing Barry Keene Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Trust Fund Act of 1989, owners and operators of petroleum underground storage tanks are required to pay a storage fee for each gallon of petroleum placed in the tank. The fees are required to be deposited in the Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund, and the money in the fund is authorized to be expended by the board, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for
		various purposes.</p><p>This bill would delete an obsolete provision regarding the transfer of funds from the fund to that account and would clarify that the funds in the account may be expended by the board for purposes of this grant program.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>NO</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>NO</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>NO</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>NO</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_3C651895-F983-41A6-8308-ECECA30BDA99"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_AMENDED" xlink:type="locator" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:HSC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'DIVISION'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'20.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawHeading%5B%40type%3D'CHAPTER'%20and%20caml%3ANum%3D'6.76.'%5D%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'25299.109.'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION">Section 25299.109 of the <caml:DocName>Health and Safety Code</caml:DocName> is amended to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_2DA40F18-5954-4A97-8332-A3DCC91616F2"><caml:Num>25299.109.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_AEABF287-B9CC-4D18-A676-7CC77A1589E5"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>The Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financing Account is hereby created in the State Treasury.
