Under existing sales and use tax regulations, gross receipts from a retail sale of a wireless telecommunication device sold in a bundled transaction with wireless telecommunication service are generally equal to the amount of the unbundled sales price of the wireless telecommunication device.</p><p>This bill would, instead, limit the gross receipts from a retail sale of a wireless telecommunication device sold in a bundled transaction with wireless telecommunication service to the bundled sales price of the wireless telecommunication device.</p><p>The Bradley-Burns
		Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorizes counties and cities to impose local sales and use taxes in conformity with the Sales and Use Tax Law, and existing law authorizes districts, as specified, to impose transactions and use taxes in accordance with the Transactions and Use Tax Law, which conforms to the Sales and Use Tax Law. Amendments to state sales and use taxes are incorporated into these laws.</p><p>Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code provides that the state will reimburse counties and cities for revenue losses caused by the enactment of sales and use tax exemptions.</p><p>This bill would provide that, notwithstanding Section 2230 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, no appropriation is made and the state shall not reimburse any local agencies for sales and use tax revenues lost by them pursuant to this bill.</p><p>This bill would take effect immediately as a tax
		levy, but its operative date would depend on its effective date.</p></caml:DigestText><caml:DigestKey><caml:VoteRequired>MAJORITY</caml:VoteRequired><caml:Appropriation>NO</caml:Appropriation><caml:FiscalCommittee>YES</caml:FiscalCommittee><caml:LocalProgram>YES</caml:LocalProgram><caml:Urgency>YES</caml:Urgency><caml:TaxLevy>YES</caml:TaxLevy><caml:DeclaringUrgency>NO</caml:DeclaringUrgency></caml:DigestKey></caml:Description><caml:Bill id="bill" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><caml:Preamble>The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</caml:Preamble><caml:BillSection id="id_3BDEBD6A-81D4-49A0-A6B1-2FA74504E0CC"><caml:Num>SECTION 1.</caml:Num><caml:ActionLine action="IS_ADDED" xlink:href="urn:caml:codes:RTC:caml#xpointer(%2Fcaml%3ALawDoc%2Fcaml%3ACode%2F%2Fcaml%3ALawSection%5Bcaml%3ANum%3D'6012.4'%5D)" xlink:label="fractionType: LAW_SECTION" xlink:type="locator">Section 6012.4 is added to the <caml:DocName>Revenue and Taxation Code</caml:DocName>, to read:</caml:ActionLine><caml:Fragment><caml:LawSection id="id_04A7F91C-99FD-4DA2-8319-1FF432D7C985"><caml:Num>6012.4.</caml:Num><caml:LawSectionVersion id="id_81F8AE61-D432-4F8D-A5BF-735434A47B01"><caml:Content><p>(a)<span class="EnSpace"/>Notwithstanding Sections 6011 and 6012, “gross receipts” and “sales price” from the retail sale of a wireless communication device shall be limited to the amount charged for the sale of the wireless telecommunication device when that device is sold in a bundled transaction.</p><p>(b)<span class="EnSpace"/>“Bundled transaction” means a retail sale of a wireless telecommunication device that contractually requires the retailer’s customer to activate or contract with a wireless telecommunications service provider for utility service for a period greater than one month as a condition of that sale.</p><p>(c)<span class="EnSpace"/>“Wireless telecommunication device” means a portable communication device, such as a wireless telephone or
